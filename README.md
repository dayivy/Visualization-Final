# Visualization-Final

## Project Overview

I want to practice visualization techniques by looking at life expectancy based on country, region of world, level of corruption, as well as correlation between life expectancy and corruption. 

## Data Source

For the life expectancy data, I acquired it from the World Bank at the following link: <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN>

And for corruption, I acquired the data from Transparency.org:  <https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020>

## Jupyter Notebook 

The jupyter notebook in this repository will cover exploratory data analysis (EDA) as well as the visualizations I created

## Summary and Discussion

A summary and discussion will be included in the repository to answer the required questions from the course.
